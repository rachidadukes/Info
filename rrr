I’m currently testing a new API URL and certificate, but I’m not sure who is responsible for maintaining or generating these.
Could someone confirm who owns the API endpoint configuration and SSL certificate management for this service, so I can coordinate testing and report any issues to the right person?



I’m testing the new API endpoint for Encore Transactions with the new certificate.
Can someone point me to the engineer or team that owns the API deployment and certificate management for this service?

API URL ownership → usually backend engineer or DevOps (might be listed in Git repo owners or Azure pipeline configs).

Certificate management → often DevOps or security/infrastructure team (check certificate renewal automation or key vault).

Environment setup (e.g., UNIT, INTG) → often handled by the release management or infrastructure team.
