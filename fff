Throughout 2025, I contributed to the ongoing modernization of the Encore system by completing numerous development, testing, and technical improvement tasks. I built a small .NET 9.0 application—later upgraded to .NET 10—to replicate legacy Encore transaction workflows and validate the new service integration with the updated certificate. This initiative allowed me to identify compatibility issues early and ensure a smooth transition for the production environment. In collaboration with the team, I delivered multiple enhancements, including updates to member folder functionality, transfer workflows, and security validation processes. I also implemented improvements to transaction handling, dropdown list configurations, and error correction logic, which increased reliability and streamlined internal operations. These efforts supported operational excellence and risk mitigation while aligning the Encore platform with current .NET and security standards.



===============================

1️⃣ Operational Efficiency and Excellence

This year, I focused on improving the efficiency and reliability of the Encore platform. I built a .NET 9.0 application, later upgraded to .NET 10, to replicate key Encore transaction workflows and validate the new service integration using the latest certificate. This helped identify compatibility and communication issues early, reducing testing time and deployment risk. I also contributed to numerous enhancements that streamlined operations—such as refining dropdown configurations, cleaning up commented code, and improving validation logic across multiple Encore modules.

2️⃣ Risk Management and Mitigation

I actively supported risk reduction by addressing system vulnerabilities and removing outdated integrations such as Lotus Notes dependencies. I also worked on projects that ensured accuracy and compliance, including relocating the electronic journal process, correcting transaction handling, and implementing new validation checks. These improvements strengthened overall system integrity, reduced error frequency, and aligned with enterprise security and audit requirements.

3️⃣ Strategic Project Execution

Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I completed multiple high-impact Encore initiatives, such as workflow updates to align with OneView and integration refinements for eServices. I consistently communicated with peers and stakeholders to coordinate testing, resolve issues, and ensure smooth delivery of enhancements. My work supported the team’s goal of modernizing the Encore ecosystem, driving forward the transition to newer .NET frameworks, and laying the foundation for long-term system stability and scalability.

Overall Summary

In 2025, I played a key role in advancing the modernization of the Encore system through hands-on development, testing, and system improvement initiatives. By building and refining .NET applications, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and implementing process efficiencies, I helped improve system performance, reduce risk, and support the transition to newer, more secure technologies. I’m proud of the technical depth, problem-solving, and teamwork demonstrated this year, and I look forward to continuing to strengthen our Encore platform in 2026.
