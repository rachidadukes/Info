The console app SoapLegacyClient is now correctly referencing the legacy ASMX service (HFS_EncHost.asmx)
through a Web Reference named HfsEncHostService. Youâ€™re also pointing to the correct endpoint via the App.config file.

It is a good idea to change the endpoint

<value>http://localhost:2529/HFS_EncHost.asmx</value>
inside;
<applicationSettings>
  <SoapLegacyClient.Properties.Settings>

You will change it programmatically .
we usually run the legacy services locally during development (like http://localhost:2529/...),
but in production, the real service might be hosted on a staging/production server
(e.g., https://legacy.company.com/HFS_EncHost.asmx).

Keeping the endpoint in App.config allows you to change it without recompiling the app.
