 in the HFS_EncProcessS app references the ASMX service hosted by HFS_EncHostWebServices,
we have:

<add key="encorehostservice" value="http://localhost:2529/HFS_EncHost.asmx" />
This means HFS_EncProcessS acts as a client/consumer of the HFS_EncHostWebServices.

Recommended Order:
we start HFS_EncHostWebServices (make sure itâ€™s running at http://localhost:2529/HFS_EncHost.asmx)
Then start HFS_EncProcessS.
This mirrors the production setup where Process connects to Host
