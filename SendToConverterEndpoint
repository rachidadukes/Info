to call it from Sending ✅

Dim sSendTime As String = Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss.ffff")
hostStatus = hostAdaptor.SendAndReceive(sSendMsg, sRecvMsg)
Dim sRecvTime As String = Now.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss.ffff")

LogRequestResponseTrace(sTrace, _
                        msDBID, _
                        "Send to Host", _
                        "Receive from Host", _
                        sSendTime, _
                        sRecvTime, _
                        sSendMsg, _
                        sRecvMsg, _
                        TraceMaxLogLen, _
                        "Trace to/from Host")


Just make sure you’ve:

Deleted the old If sTrace.ToLower = "sendonly" / "receiveonly" / "sendandreceive" block and the If sTraceLog.Length > 0 Then RaiseEvent ... that were under it.
