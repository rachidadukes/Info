Step 1 â€” Confirm where the cert actually lives

You must open both stores and check manually.

Press Win + R â†’ certlm.msc â†’ (LocalMachine store)

Go to Personal â†’ Certificates

Look for a certificate whose Subject contains "LTB4U" or similar.

If you donâ€™t see it there:

Press Win + R â†’ certmgr.msc â†’ (CurrentUser store)

Check Personal â†’ Certificates again.

ðŸ‘‰ Whichever location shows the cert is the one you must set in your config.
