Creating a branch locally does not automatically push it to GitHub. You need to push it manually the first time.

In Visual Studio:
After you create the new branch, go to Git Changes or click the "Publish Branch" button (top bar or bottom-right corner).

Visual Studio will push the new branch to the remote (origin) on GitHub.


==============================================
To publish the branch to GitHub from Visual Studio:
Open the “Git Changes” tab (you can also open it from View → Git Changes).

In the top bar of the Git Changes window, you should see:

scss
Copy
Edit
YourBranchName (not published)      [Publish Branch]
Click Publish Branch.

This will push Multi-tran_Adjust_Trans to the origin remote (your GitHub repository).

=================================

 Then, confirm it's on GitHub:
Go to: https://github.com/NFC-TPO/encore-main

Click the branch dropdown (next to master)

You should see Multi-tran_Adjust_Trans listed under “Branches”
