How to publish a new branch without local changes:
You can still push the branch manually to make it visible on GitHub, even if there are no code changes:

👉 Option 1: Push using Visual Studio
Go to Git > Manage Branches from the top menu.

In the list of branches, find Multi-tran_Adjust_Trans.

Right-click on it and select Push.

👉 Option 2: Use Git CLI (if you prefer)
Open a terminal and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin Multi-tran_Adjust_Trans
This command will:

Push the local branch to GitHub

Set the remote tracking so future pushes can just use git push

=================================

 Then, confirm it's on GitHub:
Go to: https://github.com/NFC-TPO/encore-main

Click the branch dropdown (next to master)

You should see Multi-tran_Adjust_Trans listed under “Branches”
